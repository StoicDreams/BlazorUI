UI Framework and component library for Blazor based Websites and Maui projects.

## **Notice:** This project is very early in development!

If I can get in and sustain a very productive groove, this project might be ready for production-level development by the end of 2022.

More realistically though, because of other priorities, time constraints, and the sheer amount of work that needs to be done, it perhaps might be closer to the end of 2023 before I would start recommending people to use this library.

In the meantime, if you're needing an awesome framework to help you develop a Blazor based project with then we highly recommend checking out [MudBlazor](https://www.mudblazor.com). Not only is it the best Blazor framework I've see or tried, but it's also free. It has a focus on Material design, and their components, documentation, and templates are much more developer friendly in my opinion than the other design frameworks I've seen and tried.

## Project Goals

This Blazor UI framework is targeting a developer experience to allow developers to be able to develop websites and Maui Blazor app (Desktop & Mobile) without needing to know or touch any html, css, or javascript.

While this project will take some inspiration from and is expected to share some features from design frameworks such as Material and Fluent design systems, it is not in our interest to strictly follow any other frameworks or design patterns. We like a lot of what they do and provide, but we also thing they do some things wrong.

We have developed and are evolving our own design patterns, and those will be reflected in this UI framework.

## Restrictions

Blazor UI is currently being designed to target Maui Blazor and Wasm focused projects. Specifically projects that use an index.html file, which Blazor UI is including from its collection of static files. Server-side Blazor projects are not expected to work.

## Project Setup

See the [Blazor UI Sample Website](https://github.com/StoicDreams/BlazorUI/tree/main/StoicDreams.SampleWebsite) for details on how to setup a new website project.

A Maui Blazor sample project will be added later after that framework and toolchain has become generally available for production use.
