        Blazor UI is for developers who want to develop a website using the .NET Blazor framework and need to develop a website or application that adheres to Material UI standards for its look and feel.

        Additionally, developers wanting to use this framework should be interested in forking the source code to build off of, since Blazor UI is no longer in active development.
